## Description

- Dead Tide is a shoot'em up game developed using the Pygame library and implementing principles of object-oriented programming. In this game, you control a cannon to defend your port against attacks from pirate ships attempting to enter the city.

- When a pirate ship docks, it unloads zombies that you must neutralize before they reach the city gates.

- If a zombie reaches the city gates, you lose one life. If you lose all your lifes, you lose the game.

- Player will be rewarded for each defeated enemy.
